# Error Handling and Logging in Neighborly

Effective error handling and logging are crucial components of any robust software system. In Neighborly, a vector database management system, these practices play a vital role in maintaining system stability, facilitating debugging, and providing insights into application behavior. This article explores the logging strategies employed in Neighborly and discusses common error scenarios along with their handling approaches.

## Logging Strategies in Neighborly

Neighborly utilizes a comprehensive logging strategy to capture important events, errors, and system states. Here are the key aspects of Neighborly's logging approach:

### 1. Use of ILogger Interface

Neighborly employs the `ILogger<T>` interface from the Microsoft.Extensions.Logging namespace. This allows for a flexible and extensible logging system that can be easily integrated with various logging providers.

```csharp
private readonly ILogger<VectorDatabase> _logger = Logging.LoggerFactory.CreateLogger<VectorDatabase>();
```

### 2. Log Levels

Different log levels are used to categorize the severity and importance of log messages:

- **Debug**: Used for detailed diagnostic information.
- **Information**: General information about application flow.
- **Warning**: For potentially harmful situations.
- **Error**: Used when exceptions or errors occur.

### 3. Structured Logging

Neighborly uses structured logging to provide context-rich log messages. This is achieved through the use of message templates and named parameters:

```csharp
_logger.LogInformation("Loaded {VectorCount} vectors from {FilePath}.", vectorCount, inputStream.Name);
```

### 4. Performance Considerations

To minimize the performance impact of logging, Neighborly uses high-performance logging techniques:

- **LoggerMessage Source Generator**: This feature generates highly optimized logging methods at compile-time, reducing the runtime overhead of logging calls.

```csharp
[LoggerMessage(
    EventId = 0,
    Level = LogLevel.Error,
    Message = "Could not find vector `{Query}` in the database searching the {k} nearest neighbor(s).")]
private partial void CouldNotFindVectorInDb(Vector query, int k, Exception ex);
```

### 5. Telemetry and Instrumentation

In addition to traditional logging, Neighborly incorporates telemetry and instrumentation for more advanced monitoring:

```csharp
_instrumentation.Meter.CreateObservableGauge(
    name: "neighborly.db.vectors.count",
    unit: "{vectors}",
    description: "The number of vectors in the database.",
    observeValue: () => Count,
    tags: [new("db.namespace", _id)]
);
```

## Common Error Scenarios and Handling

Neighborly implements various error handling strategies to manage common scenarios effectively. Here are some examples:

### 1. File Not Found

When loading data from a file that doesn't exist, Neighborly logs an error and throws a `FileNotFoundException`:

```csharp
if (!createOnNew && !fileExists)
{
    _logger.LogError("The file {FilePath} does not exist.", filePath);
    throw new FileNotFoundException($"The file {filePath} does not exist.");
}
```

### 2. Invalid Data

When encountering invalid data during operations like reading from a binary file, Neighborly throws an `InvalidDataException`:

```csharp
if (version != s_currentFileVersion)
{
    throw new InvalidDataException($"Invalid ball tree version: {version}");
}
```

### 3. Argument Validation

Neighborly uses argument validation to catch invalid input early:

```csharp
ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(logger);
```

### 4. Exception Handling in Asynchronous Operations

For asynchronous operations, Neighborly uses try-catch blocks to handle exceptions and ensure proper resource cleanup:

```csharp
try
{
    // Asynchronous operation
}
catch (UnauthorizedAccessException ex)
{
    _logger.LogError(ex, "An error occurred while saving the database. Access to the path is denied.");
}
catch (IOException ex)
{
    _logger.LogError(ex, "An error occurred while saving the database.");
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    _logger.LogError(ex, "An error occurred while saving the database.");
}
finally
{
    _rwLock.ExitWriteLock();
}
```

### 5. Graceful Degradation

In some cases, when an error occurs, Neighborly attempts to continue operation in a degraded state rather than failing completely:

```csharp
catch (Exception ex)
{
    CouldNotFindVectorInDb(query, k, ex);
    return new List<Vector>();
}
```

### 6. Activity Tracing

Neighborly uses the `System.Diagnostics.Activity` class for tracing operations across the system, which aids in debugging and performance analysis:

```csharp
using var activity = StartActivity(tags: [new("search.method", method), new("search.k", k)]);
try
{
    // Operation code
    activity?.SetStatus(ActivityStatusCode.Ok);
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    activity?.SetStatus(ActivityStatusCode.Error, ex.Message);
    // Error handling
}
```

## Conclusion

Effective error handling and logging are essential for maintaining the reliability and debuggability of Neighborly. By employing structured logging, utilizing appropriate exception handling techniques, and incorporating telemetry, Neighborly ensures that errors are properly managed and that sufficient information is available for troubleshooting and performance optimization. These practices contribute to a more robust and maintainable vector database management system.
