In the land of Middle-earth, 'neath the sky so wide,
Two wizards walked in wisdom, side by side.
Gandalf the Grey, with his staff held high,
Saruman the White, with a gleam in his eye.

They delved in deep lore, in the ancient halls,
Their voices echoed through Isengard's walls.
Once brothers in magic, in purpose aligned,
Till the lure of the ring made Saruman blind.

But imagine a tale where love conquers all,
Where Gandalf's compassion breaks down the wall.
In the golden wood, 'neath the mallorn trees,
They find a love as deep as the Sundering Seas.

Saruman's heart, once cold and misled,
Is warmed by Gandalf's touch, and the words unsaid.
Together they stand, against shadow and flame,
United in love, in more than just name.

So sing of the wizards, whose fates intertwine,
In a world where love's magic is truly divine.
For even the wise can learn something new,
When love is the lesson, and the heart is true.
