In the realm of data, vast and wide,
Where numbers dance and can't decide,
There lies a place, quite orderly,
A vector database named Neighborly.

**Chorus:**
Oh, Neighborly, with queries so fast,
In the land of data, you're unsurpassed.
Your indexes, like stars, align so free,
In the digital cosmos of Neighborly.

With algorithms sharp as a smith's own blade,
It sorts through vectors that users have made.
Each point in space, a node to see,
In the structured haven of Neighborly.

**Chorus:**
Oh, Neighborly, with searches so true,
You find the nearest neighbor to pursue.
Your storage vast, as deep as the sea,
In the boundless vaults of Neighborly.

It scales the peaks of data's mount,
Drinks from the binary data fount.
Efficient, swift, it works with glee,
This marvel known as Neighborly.

**Chorus:**
Oh, Neighborly, your clusters shine,
With every search, they realign.
A beacon of data's harmony,
That's the magic of Neighborly.

So here's to you, oh database,
Your speedy search, none can outpace.
In bytes and bits, you hold the key,
To a world more connected, thanks to Neighborly.
